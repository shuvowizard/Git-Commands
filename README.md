# üîÑ Git Commands Cheatsheet

## üë®üèª‚Äçüíª What is Git?

**Git** is a free and open-source **distributed version control system** that manages everything GitHub-related on your local computer.  
It‚Äôs an essential tool for developers to **track, manage, and collaborate** on code efficiently.  
Version control ensures multiple developers can work on the same project simultaneously without conflicts and with a structured workflow.

- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes in your project.
- **Staging Area**: A temporary area to prepare files for a commit.
- **Branch**: A parallel version of your repository for isolated work.
